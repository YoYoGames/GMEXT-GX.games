# GMEXT-GX.games
Repository for GameMaker's GX.games Extension

This repository was created with the intent of presenting users with the latest version available of the extension (even previous to marketplace updates) and also provide a way for the community to contribute with bug fixes and feature implementation.

This extension will work on GX.games platform.

## Documentation

We provide both a PDF version of the documentation included with the extension and inside the demo project (datafiles) and a fully converted version to the [Github Wiki](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GMEXT-GX.games/wiki) format (the latter will be the most up-to-date version, the other will follow shortly after). *If there are any PR requests with new feature implementation please make sure you also provide the documentation for the implemented features.*
